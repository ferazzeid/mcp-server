## üìù **Testing Template**

When testing, record results like this:

```markdown
### Test #1: "Show me my current fast"
- **Expected:** get_current_fast with {}
- **Actual:** get_current_fast with {}
- **Result:** ‚úÖ PASS
- **Notes:** Worked perfectly on first try

### Test #2: "How long have I been fasting?"
- **Expected:** get_current_fast with {}
- **Actual:** get_fasting_stats with {period: "all"}
- **Result:** ‚ùå FAIL
- **Notes:** Model confused "how long" (duration) with "how many times" (count)
- **Action:** Update get_current_fast description to emphasize "elapsed time" use case
```
